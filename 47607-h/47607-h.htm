<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> present work is a selection from the Ballads and Songs of my native
county, and I trust the publication may not be deemed an unacceptable
offering. In a polished age like the present, I am sensible that many of
the productions of our county bards will require great allowances to be
made for them. Yet have they, for the most part, a pleasing simplicity,
and artless grace, which, in the opinion of such writers as Addison,
Dryden, Percy, and others, have been thought to compensate for the want
of higher beauties; and, in the words of the latter, "If they do not
dazzle the imagination, they are frequently found to interest the
heart."</p>

<p>Wherever I have had an opportunity, I have collated my copies with the
earliest editions, retaining in the notes, in many places, the different
readings, the text in modern editions being materially changed and
frequently deteriorated. I have omitted pieces from the pens of Scott,
Wordsworth, Rogers, and other modern writers, whose works may be assumed
to be in the reader's possession. Another class, the last dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
confessions of criminals, &amp;c., have been, with few exceptions, left out,
as more appropriate for a separate volume. I trust, however, in what is
retained will be found every variety:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"From grave to gay, from lively to severe."</p>

<p>And should the reader receive one half the pleasure in perusing the
contents, that has been afforded in collecting, I shall be perfectly
satisfied.</p>

<p>In the notes prefixed to the Ballads and Songs, I have acknowledged my
obligations to the friends who have so kindly assisted me, but cannot
allow this opportunity to pass without again expressing my sincere
thanks to Edward Hailstone, esq., F.S.A., Charles Jackson, esq., and
others who have manifested so great an interest in the work.</p>

<p class="center"><b>A LEGENDARY TALE OF WHITBY ABBEY.</b></p>

<p class="center"><b><span class="smcap">By William Watkins.</span></b></p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">O</span><span class="smcap">swy</span>, king of Northumberland, being engaged in war with Penda, the
Pagan king of Mercia, he vowed that, should he come off victorious, his
daughter should dedicate herself to the service of God by a life of
celibacy, and that he would give twelve of his mansions for the erection
of monasteries. Being successful, Oswy, in order to fulfil his vow,
placed his daughter Ethelfleda, then scarcely a year old, as a nun in
the monastery called Hertesie (Stag Island), of which Lady Hilda, niece
of Edwin, first Christian king of Northumberland, was abbess; and having
procured ten hides of land, in the place called Streanshalle (Whitby),
built there in 657, a monastery for men and women of the Benedictine
order, which was dedicated to St. Peter, and Lady Hilda appointed the
first abbess. This lady was so famous for her sanctity that she attained
the name of St. Hilda, and the monastery, though dedicated to St. Peter,
is generally called after her. This abbey continued to flourish till
about the year 867, when a party of Danes, under Hinguar and Hubba,
landed at Dunsley Bay, the <i>Dunus Sinus</i> of Ptolemy, plundered the
country around, and amongst other depredations entirely destroyed the
monastery. About this period the tale is supposed to commence; the
succeeding incidents are all fictitious, and were dictated to the
author, in some measure, by the romantic situation of the abbey,
(magnificent in ruin,) which is exceedingly proper for such events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>This monastery lay in ruins till after the conquest, when king William
assigned Whitby to Hugh de Abrincis, who disposed of the place to
William de Percy, by whom the monastery was refounded about 1074, and
dedicated to St. Peter and St. Hilda. In the reign of Henry VIII. this
house shared the fate of the other monastic establishments; and its
yearly revenues, according to Dugdale, were &pound;437 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>;
and &pound;505 9<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>, according to Speed.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the year 1138, David, king of Scotland, invaded the north of England
with a numerous army, in aid of the claim of the empress Matilda, his
niece, against king Stephen. The fury of his massacres and ravages
enraged the northern barons, who assembled an army and encamped near
Northallerton. On Monday the 22nd of August, 1138, the standard was
raised on Cowton Moor, three miles north of Northallerton, and after a
severe contest the Scots were defeated and ten thousand of their number
slain; the rest, with king David and prince Henry his son, retreated
with difficulty to Carlisle. This engagement is sometimes called the
Battle of Northallerton, but generally the <cite>Battle of the Standard</cite>,
from a long pole,</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">R</span><span class="smcap">obin Hood</span>, a celebrated English outlaw, was born at Locksley, in the
county of Nottingham, in the reign of Henry II. about 1160. He is said
to have been of noble extraction, being the son of William Fitzooth by
his wife a daughter of Payn Beauchamp, baron of Bedford, and lady Roisia
de Vere, daughter of Aubrey, earl of Guisnes in Normandy,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and is
frequently styled earl of Huntingdon&mdash;a title to which, in the latter
part of his life, he actually appears to have had some sort of
pretension. In his youth he is said to have been of a wild and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
extravagant turn; insomuch that, his inheritance being consumed, and his
person outlawed for debt,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> he sought an asylum in the woods of
Barnsdale, in Yorkshire,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Sherwood, in Nottinghamshire, and,
according to some, Plumpton-park, in Cumberland.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He either found or
was afterwards joined by a number of persons, the principal being Little
John (whose surname is said to have been Nailor), William Scadlock
(Scathelock or Scarlet), George a Green (pinder or pound-keeper of
Wakefield), Much (a miller's son), and a certain monk or friar called
Tuck. "These renowned thieves," says Stowe, "continued in the woods,
despoiling and robbing the goods of the rich. They killed none but such
as would invade them, or by resistance for their own defence. The said
Robin entertained 100 tall men, good archers, with such of the spoils
and thefts as he got, upon whom 400 (were they ever so strong) durst not
give the onset. He suffered no woman to be oppressed, violated, or
otherwise molested; poor men's goods he spared, abundantly relieving
them with that which by theft he got from abbeys and the houses of rich
old carles." He died in 1247; see <cite>Robin Hood's Death and Burial</cite>, post.</p>

<p>Guy of Gisborne,&mdash;the only other memorial which I can find relating to
him is in an old satirical piece by William Dunbar, a celebrated
Scottish poet, of the fifteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> on one "Schir Thomas Nory,"
where he is named along with our hero, Adam Bell, and other worthies, it
is conjectured, of a similar stamp, but whose merits have not come to
the knowledge of posterity:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CURTALL_FRYER" id="THE_CURTALL_FRYER"></a>ROBIN HOOD AND THE CURTALL FRYER<br />
OF FOUNTAINS ABBEY.</h2>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> Curtal Friar here mentioned is undoubtedly the person so frequently
occurring in the ballads, as one of the companions of Robin Hood, under
the name of <em>Friar Tuck</em>. He is thus mentioned by Skelton, laureate, in
his "Goodly Interlude of Magnificence," written about the year 1500, and
with an evident allusion to some game now forgotten:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">

  <div class="i1">To preche oute of the pylery hole."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Curtal Friars were named, according to Dr. Stukeley, from the cord
or rope which they wore round their waist, to whip themselves with, and
were of the Franciscan order. Our friar is undoubtedly so called from
his curtal dogs, or curs as we now call them, for in fact he was not a
friar, but a monk of Fountains Abbey, which was of the Cistercian order.
Robin Hood's bow is said by Ray to have been preserved in Fountains
Abbey.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">R</span><span class="smcap">obin Hood</span> having for a long period, maintained a sort of independent
sovereignty, and set kings, judges, and magistrates at defiance, a
proclamation was published offering a considerable reward for bringing
him either dead or alive; which, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> appears to have been
productive of no greater success than former attempts for that
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> At length, the infirmities of old age increasing, and
desirous to be relieved, in a fit of sickness, by being bled, he applied
for that purpose to the prioress of Kirklees nunnery, in the parish of
Dewsbury, W. R. of Yorkshire.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> From the Sloane MS. we learn "that
being dystempered with could and age, he had great payne in his lymmes,
his bloud being corrupted, therefore, to be eased of his payne by
letting bloud, he repayred to the priores of Kyrkesly, which some say
was his aunt, a woman very skylful in physique and surgery; who,
perceyving him to be Robyn Hood, and waying howe fel an enimy he was to
religious persons, toke revenge of him for her owne howse and all others
by letting him bleed to death." This event happened in the 31st of Henry
III. (1247), and, if the date assigned to his birth be correct, about
the 87th year of his age. He was interred under some trees, at a short
distance from the precinct of the nunnery, a stone being placed over his
grave.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

think spurious:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="HISTORY_SIR_JOHN_ELAND" id="HISTORY_SIR_JOHN_ELAND"></a>HISTORY OF SIR JOHN ELAND, OF ELAND, AND HIS ANTAGONISTS.</h2>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> origin of this quarrel is not very clear, neither is it certain the
time when this ballad was written. It is said that one Exley had killed
the brother's son of sir John Eland, and that a relative, sir Robert
Beaumont, screened him from the resentment of sir John, also that the
affair was, in some measure, made up, sir John Eland having accepted of
a compensation in lieu of justice being done upon the murderer, but that
he afterwards violated the agreement; whereupon sir John got together a
considerable number of armed men, and in one night, in the month of May,
put to death the said sir Robert, and two old gentlemen, his near
relatives, Hugh de Quarmby and John de Lockwood. This is so far
confirmed by the Hopkinson MSS. in the possession of Mrs. Richardson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Currer of Eshton hall, wherein it says, "that with sir Robert Beaumont
were slain his brother William, and ... Exley, who had killed the
brother's son of sir John Eland." This manner of executing private
revenge, according to Brady, in his "History of the Reign of King

<h2><a name="THE_BOY_OF_EGREMOND" id="THE_BOY_OF_EGREMOND"></a>THE BOY OF EGREMOND.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><b>By John Bird.</b></span></p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span><span class="smcap">illiam de Meschines</span> and Cecily de Romille his wife, founders of Embsay
Priory, (says Dr. Whitaker,) were now dead, and had left a daughter,
Alice, who adopted her mother's name, Romille, and was married to
William Fitz-Duncan, nephew of David, king of Scotland. They had issue a
son, commonly called the <cite>Boy of Egremond</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> who, surviving an elder
brother, became the last hope of the family.</p>

<p>In the deep solitude of the woods, betwixt Bolton and Barden, in Craven,
four miles up the river, the Wharfe suddenly contracts itself to a rocky
channel, little more than four feet wide, and pours through the
tremendous fissure with a rapidity proportioned to its confinement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> The
place was then, as it is yet, called <cite>the Strid</cite>, from a feat often
exercised by persons of more agility than prudence, who stride from
brink to brink, regardless of the destruction which awaits a faltering
step. Such was the fate of young Romille, who inconsiderately bounded
over the chasm, with a greyhound in his leash, the animal hung back and
drew his unfortunate master into the torrent. The misfortune is said to
have occasioned the translation of the priory from Embsay to Bolton,
which was the nearest eligible site to the place where it happened.</p>

<p>This priory existed upwards of four hundred years, when it was
surrendered by Richard Moon, the prior, and fourteen of his brethren, on
the 26th Jan. 1540. On the 3rd April, 1542, the site was granted to
Henry Clifford, first earl of Cumberland, but nineteen days before his
death, for the sum of 2,490<i>l</i>; from him it has descended to the present
owner, the duke of Devonshire.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">R</span><span class="smcap">ichard II.</span>, son of the Black Prince, was born in 1366, and succeeded
his grandfather Edward III., on the throne of England, 1377; murdered in
1392. Historians differ with regard to the manner in which he was
murdered. It was long the prevailing opinion that sir Piers Exton, and
others of his guards, fell upon him in Pontefract castle, and that the
king, wresting a pole-axe from one of the murderers, soon laid four of
their number dead at his feet; but at length being overpowered, he was
struck dead with a blow of a pole-axe.</p>

<p>But it is more probable that he was starved to death; and after all
sustenance was denied him, he prolonged his unhappy life, it is said,
for a fortnight, before he reached the end of his miseries. This account
is more consistent with the story that his body was exposed in public,
and that no marks of violence were found upon it.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FELON_SEW" id="THE_FELON_SEW"></a>THE FELON SEW OF ROKEBY AND THE FRYERS OF RICHMOND.</h2>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">his</span> curious ballad was first published in Dr. Whitaker's "History of
Craven," in 1805, but, from an inaccurate manuscript, not corrected very
happily. It was transferred by Mr. Evans to the new edition of his
Ballads, with some well-judged conjectural improvements. Sir Walter
Scott, in "Rokeby," has given a more authentic and full, though still
an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> imperfect, edition of this humoursome composition, from being
furnished with a copy from a manuscript in the possession of Mr. Rokeby,
of Northamptonshire, descended of the ancient barons of Rokeby. It has
three or four stanzas more than that of Dr. Whitaker, and the language
seems, where they differ, to have the more ancient and genuine readings.</p>

<p>Ralph Rokeby, esq. who bestowed this intractable animal on the convent
of Richmond, seems to have flourished in the time of Henry VII., which,
since we know not the date of Friar Theobald's wardenship, to which the
ballad refers us, may indicate that of the composition itself.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> subject of this ballad is the great Northern Insurrection in the
12th of Elizabeth, 1569. It happened thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The zealous adherents of the Romish religion being dissatisfied at the
change, formed the design of re-establishing that faith, restoring Mary
of Scotland to her liberty, and placing her on the throne of England.
The earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, who possessed great power
in the north, having held together several conferences, orders were
despatched by Elizabeth to these noblemen to appear at court, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
answer for their conduct. This order from the queen precipitated the
rising before they were fully prepared, for the leaders had already
proceeded so far that they dare not trust themselves in the queen's
hands. They determined to begin the insurrection without delay; and
committed themselves irrevocably by entering Durham in arms, on the 14th
November, 1569. This rising was speedily suppressed, and martial law
having been proclaimed, great severity was exercised. The earl of
Northumberland and many gentlemen were executed; sixty-six petty
constables were hanged; and not less than eight hundred persons are said
to have suffered by the hands of the executioner. Between Newcastle and
Wetherby, a district of sixty miles in length by forty in breadth, there
was not a town or village in which some of the inhabitants did not
expire on the gibbet.</p>

<h2><a name="MOTHER_SHIPTON" id="MOTHER_SHIPTON"></a>MOTHER SHIPTON.</h2>


<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">radition</span> tells us that near the Dropping Well, at Knaresborough, this
famous Yorkshire Sybil was born, about the year 1487; she married Tobias
Shipton, a carpenter of Shipton, near York; and from this match derived
the name of Mother Shipton. Many tales of her skill in futurity are
still related in the county; the whole of which, including a series of
succeeding events, are stated to have been delivered to the abbot of
Beverley, as in the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"A maiden queen full many a year,</div>
  <div class="i1">Shall England's warlike sceptre bear."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Spoken of queen Elizabeth, that was beloved by her subjects, and dreaded
by her enemies, above forty years.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"The western monarch's wooden horses,</div>
  <div class="i1">Shall be destroy'd by Drake's forces."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The king of Spain's mighty armada, in 1588, was destroyed by the English
fleet.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"Triumphant death rides London thro',</div>
  <div class="i1">And men on tops of houses go."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first line points to the great sickness in London, in 1665; the
second to the dreadful fire in the following year.</p>

<p>This famous prophetess died in the fifty-ninth year of her age,
fulfilling her own prediction, even to the day and hour. On her tomb was
placed this epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1"><i>Here lies she who seldom ly'd,</i></div>
  <div class="i1"><i>Whose skill so often has been try'd.</i></div>

  <div class="i1"><i>And ever keep her name alive.</i></div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span><span class="smcap">illiam Nevison</span> was born in Yorkshire, though the place is uncertain;
some say at Nevison hall, in Upsall, near Thirsk, others, at Pontefract
and Wortley. He was notorious during the reign of Charles II., and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
named by the "merry monarch" <cite>Swift Nick</cite>. After committing a robbery in
London, about sunrise, he rode his mare to York in the course of the
day, and appeared upon the Bowling-green of that city before sunset.
From this latter circumstance, when brought to trial for the offence, he
established an <i>alibi</i> to the satisfaction of the jury, though he was in
reality guilty. But, though he escaped this time, he was afterwards
apprehended in a public-house at Sandal-three-Houses, near Wakefield,
for another offence, convicted and hanged at York, May 4th, 1685. "Thus
it was related," says lord Macaulay in his "History of England," "of
William Nevison, the great robber of the north of Yorkshire, that he
levied a quarterly tribute on all the northern drovers, and in return
not only spared them himself, but protected them against all other
thieves; that he demanded purses in the most courteous manner; that he
gave largely to the poor what he had taken from the rich; that his life
was once spared by the royal clemency, but that he again tempted his
fate, and at length died, in 1685, on the gallows at York."</p>

<h2><a name="ROSEBERRY_TOPPING" id="ROSEBERRY_TOPPING"></a>ROSEBERRY TOPPING.</h2>

<p><span class="drop-cap">R</span><span class="smcap">oseberry</span>, or Rosebury Topping, originally, it is said, called
"Ottenberg," is a conical hill, situated at the north-west angle of the
Eastern moorlands known as the Cleveland hills, near the village of
Newton, about one mile to the east of the road from Guisbro' to
Stokesley. It is about 1488 feet above the level of the sea, and, by its
detatched position and superior elevation, it commands in all directions
a prospect at once extensive and interesting, and serves as a land-mark
to navigators.</p>

<p>Upon the top of the hill issues, from a large rock, a fountain of very
clear water, to which the following very ancient tradition is connected.
When king Oswald of Northumberland's son, Oswald, was born, the wise men
and magicians were sent for to court, to predict and foretell the life
and fortune of the newborn prince; they all agreed that he would when
half a year old be drowned. The indulgent maternal queen would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
carried him to Chiviot, a remarkable hill in their own county, but for
the troubles then subsisting in the north; she, therefore, for his
better security, brought him to a lofty hill in peaceful Cleveland,
called Roseberry, and caused a cell or cave to be made near the top
thereof, in order to prevent his foretold unhappy death. But, alas! in
vain; for the fates, who spare nobody, dissolved the rugged rocks into a
flowing stream, and, by drowning the son, put a period to all the
mother's cares, though not her sorrows; for ordering him to be interred
in Tivotdale (Osmotherley) church, she mourned with such inconsolable
grief that she soon followed him, and was, according to her fervent
desire, laid by her tenderly-beloved, darling child. The heads of the
mother and son, cut in stone, may be seen at the east end of the church;
and from a saying of the people, "Os by his mother lay," Tivotdale got
the name of Osmotherley.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHILD_IN_THE_WOOD" id="THE_CHILD_IN_THE_WOOD"></a>THE CHILD IN THE WOOD; OR THE CRUEL UNKLE.</h2>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the town of Beverley, in Yorkshire, about two years ago [1703], there
lived one squire Somers, a very honest gentleman of about three hundred
per ann.; his wife dying, by whom he had one little daughter, about two
years of age, he continued some months a sorrowful widower; he could not
well enjoy himself after the loss of his dear spouse. And it so happened
that, partly out of grief, partly from a violent fever, he was brought
to his bed of sickness, where he continued not long, for he died within
a fortnight after he was taken by that fever. He expressed a great
concern for his little girl, and therefore called his brother, a
gentleman that lived about fourteen miles from him, and begged him to
take the care of his daughter upon him. "Brother," said he, "I leave
with you the dearest thing that I have in the world&mdash;my little daughter,
and with her to you I intrust my estate; manage it for her use, and take
care of her education in virtue and religion; use her as if she were
your own, and, for my sake, see her married to an honest country
gentleman." All which was faithfully promised by the brother. Thus, when
all things were settled, the gentleman dies, and the brother takes home
the child to his house, and for some time used her kindly. But at the
last, the devil of covetousness possessed him; nothing run in his mind
so much as making away with the child, and so possess the estate. After
many ways, he at last concluded to take her with him, and hide her in a
hollow tree; which one morning he effected, and left the poor infant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
with her mouth stopped that she might not cry. For he had so much grace
not actually to murder her, therefore he left her alive in the hollow of
the tree; and, the better to hide the matter, gave out that the child
was dead, and, therefore, caused an effigy of wax to be made, laid it in
a coffin, and a shroud, and made a great funeral for the child. Thus the
effigy was buried, and no notice at all taken of the matter. At the same
time, a neighbouring gentleman dreamed that that day he should see
something that would sufficiently astonish him. He told it to his lady,
who dissuaded him from going a hunting that day; but he was resolved,
not giving any credit to dreams, and so takes horse in the morning. As
he was a hunting, he happened to be in the wood where the child was, and
as he was riding by the tree his horse gave a great start, so that he
had liked to have fallen down; and turning about, to see what was the
matter, he saw something stir in a hole, and being inquisitive to know
the cause, his dream presently came in his head, and therefore he calls
his man, and bids him examine what was in the hole; who, having searched
the tree, discovers the child in the tree. He took it out, and his
master carried it to his lady almost dead; he told her his dream was
out, declaring how he found the child, and begged her to take care of
it. The child was revived, and in a little time brought to itself again;
but they could not imagine whose it was; till at last it happened that
some woman came to the gentleman's house, a singing at Christmas, and
seeing the child, knew it, and declared whose it was, and that it was
supposed to be dead and buried. The gentleman goes and prevails with the
minister of the parish to have the grave opened, and found the waxen
effigy of the child in the grave. He went to the justice of the peace,
to whom he declared the matter; who sent his warrant for the child's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
trustee, who, being convicted of the matter, was not able to deny it,
but confessed all the business. But seeing the child was alive, it is
supposed he will not be tried for his life, but it is thought a severe
punishment will be inflicted on him; and the justice appointed the
gentleman that found the child to be its trustee till the assizes. The
child is now at the gentleman's house, who loves it as if it was his
own, for he has no children himself, and is a man of a good estate, and
is likely to augment very much the child's fortune.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">R</span><span class="smcap">oger Wrightson</span>, at the sign of the King's Head, in Bowes, in the N. R.
of Yorkshire, courted widow Railton's daughter, at the sign of the
George in the same town, and has done more than a year. On Shrove
Tuesday, 1715, he fell sick, and languished till Sunday next but one
following, and after saying three times, "Martha, Martha, come away,"
then died.</p>

<p>Poor Martha (for that was the maid's name whom he courted) Railton,
though privately, took heavily on all that time, and only had declared
to her sister and mother that if he died she could not live. An honest
friend is unworthily blamed for doing what I<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> would have done myself
had I known it; for Martha Railton begged of him to go and see young
Roger, and tell him she would gladly come and see him, if he thought fit
(knowing all his father's family was against her). Roger answered, "Nay,
nay, T&mdash;my, our folks will be mad; but tell her I hope I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
recover." Well, the poor lass, almost dead in sorrow, first sent an
orange, but Roger's mother sent it back; yet about three days before his
death Martha went. His mother was so civil as to leave her by his
bedside, and ordered her daughter Hannah to come away, but she would
not. Poor Martha wanted only to speak three words to him, and (although
she stayed two hours) yet Hannah would not let her have an opportunity,
and so, in a sorrowful manner, she left him. Her book was her constant
work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday; and she would oft say to herself,
"Oh! you Hannah! if he dyes my heart will burst." So on the same Sunday
se'night, at five o'clock in the afternoon, the bell was tolled for him,
and upon the first toll, Martha lay by her book, got her mother in her
arms, with, "Oh! dear mother, he's dead, I cannot live." About three
minutes after Thomas Petty went in and desired her to be more easy. Her
answer was, "Nay, now my heart is burst!" And so, in mournful cries and
prayers, was fainter and fainter, for about three hours, and seemed to
breathe her last; but her mother and another girl of the town shrieked
aloud, and so called her back again (as they term it), and, in amazed
manner, distorted with convulsion fits (just as it is described in Dr.
Taylor's "Holy Living and Dying"), stayed her spirit ten or twelve hours
longer, and then she died.</p>

<p>At last things was brought to this issue, to be buried both in one
grave, and the corpse met at the church gate, but Hannah objected
against their being buried together, as also she did at her being laid
first in the grave; but was answered that a bride has to go first to
bed. She, being asked why she should be so proud and inhumane, answered,
that she said, "Martha might have taken fairer on, or have been hanged."
But oh, the loud mourning of friends on both sides at the corpse
meeting, and more at the grave; wherein first she was decently laid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span><span class="smcap">orthy Sir</span>,&mdash;He who sits down to write anything for the public benefit,
without fixing on the person to whom he shall dedicate it, knows little
of the art of authorizing, for perhaps when he has finished his work he
may not know any person to whom the subject may be agreeable, or that
has generosity enough to pay for washing the clean ruffles he is obliged
to put on when he waits on him to implore his protection. But I
generally take another way, and make my Patron before I begin my work,
and suit the subject according to his capacity and genius. As, for
example, if I write a book of History and Politics, I have Mr. Alderman
Smith<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> for that; if of Love and Gallantry, who can be so good a
judge as your neighbour Mr. Taylor; if of Wit and Humour,
I have Mr. Alderman Cave<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> in my eye; if of Sobriety and Temperance, no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
can be so proper as the Rev. Mr. Willatts;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> if I write in praise of
and recommend the practice of Generosity, Public Spirit, and Patriotism,
and urge the indispensable duty of a good subject, not only to hazard
his fortune, but even his person, for the good of his country, no man
can be so proper as <span class="smcap">Richard Turbutt</span>, esq.,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> as all those virtues are
conspicuous in him in the highest degree. It is for this reason I humbly
lay the inclosed lines at your feet, and implore your patronage of them.
Should I say any more in your praise it would offend your known modesty,
which has always been remarkably impatient at hearing yourself praised,
even for those things for which some people (otherwise greedy of praise)
would think they deserved no praise at all. But, to be serious with you,
I wish this trifle may divert you during your unhappy confinement. To
make you and your young ladies laugh, it will more than answer the most
sanguine expectations of, &amp;c. &amp;c. <span class="smcap"><b>John Ellerker</b>.</span><a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<h2><a name="THE_ROMANBY_TRAGEDY" id="THE_ROMANBY_TRAGEDY"></a>THE ROMANBY TRAGEDY.</h2>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> remorseless tragedy on which this ballad is founded took place
upwards of a century ago. In the village of Romanby, near Northallerton,
there resided a desperate band of coiners, whose respectability and
cunning concealment precluded all possibility of suspicion as to their
proceedings. The victim of their revenge was Mary Ward, the servant of
one of those ruffians. Having obtained an accidental view of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
secret apartments appropriated to their treasonable practices, she
unguardedly communicated her knowledge to an acquaintance, which
reaching her master's ears, he determined to destroy her. The most
plausible story, time, and means were selected for this purpose. On a
Sunday evening, after sunset, an unknown personage on horseback arrived
at her master's mansion, half equipped, to give colour to his alleged
haste, and stated that he was dispatched for Mary, as <i>her mother was
dying</i>. She lingered to ask her master's permission, but he feigned
sleep, and she departed without his leave. On the table of her room was
her Bible, opened at these remarkable words in Job, "They shall seek me
in the morning, and shall not find me; and where I am, they shall not
come." Her home was at the distance of eight miles from Romanby, and
Morton bridge, hard by the heath where she was murdered, is the
traditionary scene of her nocturnal revisitings. The impression of her
re-appearance is only poetically assumed, for there is too much of what
Coleridge would term "the divinity of nature" around Morton bridge, to
warrant its association with supernatural mysteries.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> inhabitants of the Yorkshire coast were frequently, about the year
1779, thrown into a state of alarm by that intrepid Anglo-American
buccanier, Paul Jones. This man had formerly been in the service of the
earl of Selkirk, whence he was expelled with disgrace, and having
repaired to America he volunteered to make a descent on the British
coast. Being entrusted with the command of a privateer, he effected a
landing at Whitehaven, and set fire to some shipping in the arbour. He
sailed for Scotland, where he landed on the estate of the earl of
Selkirk, and plundered his lordship's house of all the plate. These
services insured his promotion, and procured him the command of the Bon
Homme Richard, and the Alliance, each of 40 guns; the Pallas, of 32
guns; and the Vengeance, armed brig. With this force he made many
valuable captures, insulted the coast of Ireland, and even threatened
the city of Edinburgh. On Monday, the 20th Sept. 1779, an express
arrived at Bridlington, from the bailiffs of Scarborough, with
intelligence that an enemy was cruising off the coast. On Thursday a
valuable fleet of British merchantmen from the Baltic, under the convoy
of the Serapis, Capt. Pearson, of 44 guns, and the Countess of
Scarborough, Capt. Piercy, of 22 guns, hove in sight, and were chased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
by the enemy. The first care of Capt. Pearson was to place himself between
the enemy and his convoy; by which man&oelig;uvre he enabled the whole of the
merchantmen to escape into the port of Scarborough. About half-past seven
o'clock the thunder of the cannon announced that an engagement had
commenced; the battle raged with unabated fury for two hours, when at
length Capt. Pearson, who was engaged by the two largest of the enemy's
ships, was compelled to surrender. Capt. Piercy, after a long and gallant
defence, was in the end obliged to strike to the Pallas. The enemy
purchased the victory at a prodigious price, more than 300 men being
killed or wounded in the Richard alone, which vessel received so much
injury, that she sunk next day with many of the wounded on board.</p>

<p>Capt. Pearson afterwards received the honour of knighthood; and the
freedom of the borough of Scarborough was presented to him and his
gallant colleague, Capt. Piercy, in two boxes of "heart of oak,"
ornamented with silver.</p>

  <div class="i7"><span class="smcap"><b>Part I.</b></span></div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">In famous York city a farmer did dwell,</div>
  <div class="i1">Who was belov'd by his neighbours full well;</div>
  <div class="i1">He had a good wife that was virtuous and fair,</div>
  <div class="i1">And by her he had a child every year.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">In seven years' time six children they had,</div>
  <div class="i1">Which made both the father and mother's heart glad.</div>
  <div class="i1">But a little time, as we do hear say,</div>
  <div class="i1">This farmer in wealth and stock did decay;</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">Although that once he had riches great store,</div>
  <div class="i1">In little time after he quickly grew poor;</div>
  <div class="i1">He strove all he could, but alas! could not thrive,</div>
  <div class="i1">Nor hardly could keep his poor children alive.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">But children came faster than silver or gold,</div>
  <div class="i1">For his wife she conceived again, we are told,</div>
  <div class="i1">And when her time came, in hard travail she fell;</div>
  <div class="i1">But, if you will mind, a strange wonder I'll tell.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">A rich noble knight did chance to ride by,</div>
  <div class="i1">And hearing this woman to shriek and cry;</div>
  <div class="i1">He being well learned in planets and signs,</div>
  <div class="i1">Did look on a book which puzzled his mind:</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">For the more he did look, still the more he did read,</div>
  <div class="i1">And found that the fate this young child had decreed,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">Who was born in that house that same hour and tide,</div>
  <div class="i1">He found it was she that must be his sweet bride.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">But judge how the knight was disturbed in mind,</div>
  <div class="i1">When he in that book his own fortune did find;</div>
  <div class="i1">He quickly rode home, but was sorely oppress'd;</div>
  <div class="i1">From that very moment he could have no rest;</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">All night he did tumble and toss in his bed,</div>
  <div class="i1">And very strange projects did run in his head;</div>
  <div class="i1">Then he was resolved very quickly indeed,</div>
  <div class="i1">To alter that fortune he found was decreed.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">With a murdering heart next morning he rose,</div>
  <div class="i1">And to the house of the farmer he goes;</div>
  <div class="i1">Then asking the man, with a heart full of spite,</div>
  <div class="i1">If the child was alive that was born last night?</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">"Worthy sir," says the farmer, "although I'm poor,</div>
  <div class="i1">I had one born last night, and six long before;</div>
  <div class="i1">Four sons and three daughters I now have alive,</div>
  <div class="i1">Which are all in good health and likely to thrive."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The knight he reply'd, "If that seven you have,</div>
  <div class="i1">Let me have the youngest, I'll keep her most brave;</div>
  <div class="i1">For you very well with one daughter can spare,</div>
  <div class="i1">Which, if you will grant, I will make her my heir:</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">"For I am a knight of noble degree,</div>
  <div class="i1">And if you will part with your child unto me,</div>
  <div class="i1">Full three hundred pounds unto you I will give,</div>
  <div class="i1">When I from your hands your daughter receive."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The father and mother, with tears in their eyes,</div>
  <div class="i1">Did hear this fine offer, and were in surprize;</div>
  <div class="i1">And seeing the knight so gallant and gay,</div>
  <div class="i1">Presented the infant unto him that day.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
  <div class="i2">But they spoke to him with words most mild,</div>
  <div class="i1">"We beseech you, kind sir, to be kind to our child."</div>
  <div class="i1">"You need not fear it," the knight did say,</div>
  <div class="i1">"For I will maintain her most gallant and gay."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">Then with this sweet baby away he did ride,</div>
  <div class="i1">Until that he came to a broad river side;</div>
  <div class="i1">With cruelty bent he resolved, indeed,</div>
  <div class="i1">To drown the young infant that moment with speed.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">Says he, "If you live, you must needs be my wife;</div>
  <div class="i1">But I am resolved to bereave you of life:</div>
  <div class="i1">For 'till you are dead I no other can have,</div>
  <div class="i1">Therefore you shall lie in a watery grave."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">In speaking these words, that moment, they say,</div>
  <div class="i1">He flung the sweet babe in the river straightway;</div>
  <div class="i1">And being well pleased when this he had done,</div>
  <div class="i1">Did leap on his horse and quickly rode home.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">But mind how good fortune did for her provide,</div>
  <div class="i1">For the child was drove safe on her back by the tide.</div>
  <div class="i1">There was a man fishing as fortune would have,</div>
  <div class="i1">Who saw the child floating upon the salt wave.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">He soon took her up but was in amaze,</div>
  <div class="i1">He kiss'd her, and bless'd her, and on her did gaze;</div>
  <div class="i1">And seeing he had ne'er a child in his life,</div>
  <div class="i1">He presently carried her home to his wife.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">His wife she was pleased the child for to see,</div>
  <div class="i1">And said, "My dear husband, be ruled by me,</div>
  <div class="i1">Since we have no child, if you let me alone,</div>
  <div class="i1">We'll keep this sweet baby and call it our own."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The good man consented, as I have been told,</div>
  <div class="i1">And spared for neither silver nor gold,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">Until she was aged eleven full years;</div>
  <div class="i1">And then her sweet beauty began to appear.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="p1"><span class="smcap"><b>Part II.</b></span></div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The fisherman he was one time at an inn,</div>
  <div class="i1">And several gentlemen drinking with him;</div>
  <div class="i1">The wife sent this girl to call the good man home;</div>
  <div class="i1">But when she did into the drinking room come,</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The gentlemen all were amazed to see,</div>
  <div class="i1">The fisherman's daughter so full of beauty;</div>
  <div class="i1">They asked him, presently, if it was his own?</div>
  <div class="i1">Who told the whole story before he went home.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">"As I was a fishing within my own bound,</div>
  <div class="i1">One Monday morning this sweet babe I found;</div>
  <div class="i1">'Tis eleven years past since her life I did save,</div>
  <div class="i1">Or else she had lain in a watery grave."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The cruel knight was in this company;</div>
  <div class="i1">And hearing the fisherman tell the story,</div>
  <div class="i1">Was vexed at the heart for in seeing her alive;</div>
  <div class="i1">And how to destroy her again he did strive.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">Then spoke to the goodman, and to him said,</div>
  <div class="i1">"If that you will part with this pretty young maid,</div>
  <div class="i1">I'll give you whatever your heart can device,</div>
  <div class="i1">For she in good time to great riches will rise."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The fisherman answered with modest grace,</div>
  <div class="i1">"I cannot, unless my dear wife was in place;</div>
  <div class="i1">Get first her consent, you shall have her for me,</div>
  <div class="i1">And then to go with you, good sir, she is free."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
  <div class="i2">He got the wife's leave, and the girl with him went;</div>
  <div class="i1">But little they thought of his cruel intent:</div>
  <div class="i1">He kept her a month very bravely they say,</div>
  <div class="i1">And then he contrived to make her away.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">For he had a brother in Lancashire,</div>
  <div class="i1">A noble rich man worth two thousand a year;</div>
  <div class="i1">He sent this young girl unto him with speed,</div>
  <div class="i1">In hopes he would act a most barbarous deed.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">He sent a man with her, likewise they say;</div>
  <div class="i1">But as they did lodge at an inn by the way,</div>
  <div class="i1">A thief in the house, with an evil intent,</div>
  <div class="i1">To rob the port-mantua immediately went:</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">But the thief was amazed when he could not find</div>
  <div class="i1">No clothes, gold or silver, or ought to his mind:</div>
  <div class="i1">But only a letter, the which he did read,</div>
  <div class="i1">And put an end to this desperate deed.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The cruel knight wrote to his brother that day,</div>
  <div class="i1">To make the young innocent damsel away</div>
  <div class="i1">With sword or with poison, that very same night,</div>
  <div class="i1">And not let her live to the next morning light.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">When the thief read the letter, he had so much grace,</div>
  <div class="i1">To tear it, and write in the very same place,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">Dear brother, receive the young maiden from me,</div>
  <div class="i1">And bring her up well as a lady should be.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">Let her be esteemed, dear brother, I pray;</div>
  <div class="i1">Let servants attend her by night and by day;</div>
  <div class="i1">For she is a lady of noble great worth,</div>
  <div class="i1">A more noble lady ne'er lived in the north.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">Let her have good learning, dear brother, I pray,</div>
  <div class="i1">And you for the same I'll sufficiently pay;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">So, loving brother, my letter I end,</div>
  <div class="i1">Subscribing myself your dear brother and friend.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The maid and the servant were both innocent,</div>
  <div class="i1">And onward their journey next morning they went;</div>
  <div class="i1">Before the sun set to the knight's they did come,</div>
  <div class="i1">Where the servant did leave her, and turned home.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The girl was attended most bravely indeed,</div>
  <div class="i1">With men and with maidens to serve her at need:</div>
  <div class="i1">Where she did continue whole twelvemonths' space,</div>
  <div class="i1">Till this cruel knight came to the place.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">As he and his brother together did talk,</div>
  <div class="i1">He spy'd the fair maid in the garden to walk;</div>
  <div class="i1">She looked most beautiful, pleasant and gay,</div>
  <div class="i1">Like to fair Aurora, the goddess of May.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">He was in a passion, when her he did 'spy,</div>
  <div class="i1">And said, very angry, "Brother, oh! why,</div>
  <div class="i1">Pray did you not do, as in the letter I wrote?"</div>
  <div class="i1">His brother reply'd, "It is done every bit."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">"No, no, said the knight, it is not I see,</div>
  <div class="i1">Therefore she shall again go with me."</div>
  <div class="i1">But his brother did show him the letter that day;</div>
  <div class="i1">Then he was amazed, but nothing did say.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="p1"><span class="smcap"><b>Part III.</b></span></div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">Soon after the knight took this maiden away,</div>
  <div class="i1">And with her did ride, till they came to the sea;</div>
  <div class="i1">Then looking on her with anger and spite,</div>
  <div class="i1">He spoke to the virgin, and bid her alight.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The maid from her horse immediately went,</div>
  <div class="i1">And trembled to think what it was that he meant;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">"Ne'er tremble," said he, "for this hour is your last,</div>
  <div class="i1">Then pull off your clothes, I command you in haste."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The virgin, with tears in her eyes, did reply,</div>
  <div class="i1">"Oh! what have I done that now I must die?</div>
  <div class="i1">Oh! let me but know how I did you offend,</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">"Oh! spare but my life, and I'll wander the earth,</div>
  <div class="i1">And never come near you while that I have breath."</div>
  <div class="i1">He hearing this pitiful moan she did make,</div>
  <div class="i1">Then from his own finger a ring he did take,</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">And unto this maiden in anger did say,</div>
  <div class="i1">"This ring in the water I'll now throw away;</div>
  <div class="i1">Pray look on it well, the posey is plain,</div>
  <div class="i1">And when you see it may know it again.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">"I charge you for life, ne'er come more in my sight,</div>
  <div class="i1">For if you do, I shall owe you a spite;</div>
  <div class="i1">Unless that you bring the same ring unto me."</div>
  <div class="i1">With that, he let the ring drop into the sea:</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">Which when he had done, from the maid he did go,</div>
  <div class="i1">And left her to wander in sorrow and woe.</div>
  <div class="i1">She rambled all night, and at last did espy</div>
  <div class="i1">A homely poor cottage, and to it did hie.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">Being hungry and cold, with a heart full of grief,</div>
  <div class="i1">She went to the cottage and asked for relief:</div>

  <div class="i1">They got her a service, as I do hear say,</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">At a nobleman's house, not far from that place,</div>
  <div class="i1">Where she behaved herself with modest grace;</div>
  <div class="i1">She was a cook maid, and forgot all things past,</div>

 <div class="stanza">

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">At viewing it well, she did find it to be</div>
  <div class="i1">The very same ring the knight threw into the sea.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The hard hearted knight to this place he came,</div>

  <div class="i2">Sneering he spake, then turn'd about,</div>
  <div class="i1">Took up his chapeau, and walked out.</div>
  <div class="i1">Ghastly and wild his worship stagger'd,</div>
  <div class="i1">And look'd as if he had been dagger'd.</div>
  <div class="i1">Stung to the stomach with vexation,</div>
  <div class="i1">The aldermen all roar'd, "Damnation!"</div>
  <div class="i1">The meeting, silent as the breaking day,</div>
  <div class="i1">Soft as the mountain snow did melt away.</div>
  <div class="i1">At first his worship stamp'd and storm'd and swore</div>
  <div class="i1">He never had been made a fool before,</div>
  <div class="i1">And therefore could not overlook it!</div>
  <div class="i1">But, second thoughts are best&mdash;his worship then</div>
  <div class="i1">Swore that he'd ne'er be made a fool again,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">So put his vengeance in his pocket!</div>

  <div class="i1">A fine Yorkshire boy he had for his man,</div>

  <div class="i1">And there sold his cow for six pounds ten.</div>
<br /> </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">He went to the ale-house in order to drink,</div>
  <div class="i1">Where the farmer he paid down the boy all his chink,</div>
  <div class="i1">The boy to the mistress this he did say,</div>
  <div class="i1">"Now what shall I do with my money, I pray?"</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"I'll sew it up in thy coat lining," said she,</div>
  <div class="i1">"For fear on the road thou robbed should be."</div>
  <div class="i1">And there sat a highwayman drinking of wine,</div>
  <div class="i1">Thought he to himself this money is mine.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">The boy took his leave and homeward did go,</div>
  <div class="i1">The highwayman soon followed after also,</div>
  <div class="i1">He soon overtook him upon the highway,</div>
  <div class="i1">"You are well overtaken, young man," he did say.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"Will you get up behind me?" the highwayman said</div>
  <div class="i1">"How far are you going?" replied the lad.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">They rode till they came to a very dark lane,</div>
  <div class="i1">"Now," says the highwayman, "I will tell you plain,</div>

  <div class="i1">Or else I will certainly take your sweet life."</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">The boy found that there was no time for dispute,</div>
  <div class="i1">And so he alighted without fear or doubt;</div>
  <div class="i1">He tore his coat lining, the money pulled out,</div>
  <div class="i1">And amongst the long grass he strewed it about.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">The highwayman also jumped down from his horse,</div>
  <div class="i1">But little did he dream that it was for his loss;</div>
  <div class="i1">But before they could find all the money, they say</div>
  <div class="i1">The boy jumped on horseback and so rode away.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">The highwayman shouted and begg'd him to stay,</div>

  <div class="i1">And to his old master the whole he did bring,</div>
  <div class="i1">Horse, saddle, and bridle, a very fine thing.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">The master he came to the door and said thus:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">"What the deuce! has my cow turned into a horse?"</div>
  <div class="i1">"Oh, no, canny master, your cow I have sold,</div>
  <div class="i1">But was robbed on the road by a highwayman bold.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"My money I strewed about on the ground,</div>
  <div class="i1">For to take it up the rogue lighted down,</div>
  <div class="i1">And while he was popping it into his purse,</div>
  <div class="i1">To make him amends I came off with his horse."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">The master he laughed till his sides he had to hold,</div>
  <div class="i1">He says, "For a boy thou hast been very bold;</div>
  <div class="i1">And as for the villain thou hast served him right,</div>
  <div class="i1">Thou hast put upon him a clean Yorkshire bite."</div>

  <div class="i1">Listen, Yorkshire gentlemen,</div>
  <div class="i2">Unto the tale I tell,</div>
  <div class="i1">'Tis of a strange adventure</div>
  <div class="i2">That once a lord befel,</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Who took his way with horse and hound,</div>
  <div class="i2">With huntsman and with horn,</div>
  <div class="i1">To chase the wily fox I ween,</div>
  <div class="i2">One autumn's merry morn.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Long did they seek the cunning one,</div>
  <div class="i2">And roamed with labour vain,</div>
  <div class="i1">Through many a thorny thicket,</div>
  <div class="i2">O'er many a woody plain;</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">No traces of sly reynard,</div>
  <div class="i2">Their closest search can find,</div>
  <div class="i1">There is no track upon the ground,</div>
  <div class="i2">No scent upon the wind.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">The hunters are impatient all,</div>
  <div class="i2">The huntsman swears, "In vain</div>
  <div class="i1">We've beaten round, we've beaten square,</div>
  <div class="i2">No fox is on the plain.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"We might as well call off the hounds</div>
  <div class="i2">And come another day,</div>
  <div class="i1">Old N&mdash;k must have been hunting here</div>
  <div class="i2">And driven them away."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"If we had caught him in the act,"</div>
  <div class="i2">The angry lord replies,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">"We would have chased him home again,</div>
  <div class="i2">And made his brush our prize:</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"Or if he would but come to day,</div>
  <div class="i2">We'd give him such a run,</div>
  <div class="i1">As he ne'er had in all his life,</div>
  <div class="i2">O, 'twould be noble fun!"</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">So spake the lord and huntsman,</div>
  <div class="i2">When to their great surprise,</div>
  <div class="i1">A noble fox unkenelled</div>
  <div class="i2">Before their wondering eyes,</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">As black as any raven,</div>
  <div class="i2">As glossy and as bright,</div>
  <div class="i1">Save that his brush&mdash;no hunter's prize,</div>
  <div class="i2">Is tipp'd with shining white.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">The huntsman wakes from wonder,</div>
  <div class="i2">And gives a cheering blast,</div>
  <div class="i1">The hounds reply in thunder,</div>
  <div class="i2">The hunters follow fast.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Away they go a gallant band,</div>
  <div class="i2">Ye would have thought they flew;</div>
  <div class="i1">Their horses were the fleetest</div>
  <div class="i2">That Yorkshire ever knew.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">O'er many a lofty fence they pass,</div>
  <div class="i2">O'er many a gate and stile,</div>
  <div class="i1">The sable one is leading them</div>
  <div class="i2">Many a dreary mile.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">And always full before their eyes,</div>
  <div class="i2">Nor far before the hound,</div>

  <div class="i2">As merrily as the wind.</div>

  <div class="i1">The staunchest hounds are wearied</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">When at the sinking of the day</div>
  <div class="i2">They gain'd a river's side,</div>
  <div class="i1">Without a moment's stop or stay</div>
  <div class="i2">The fox takes to the tide.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Here stop the lord and huntsman,</div>
  <div class="i2">Their courage is no more,</div>
  <div class="i1">They dare not trust their horses</div>
  <div class="i2">Amidst the waves of Yore.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Both hound, and horse, and hunters,</div>
  <div class="i2">Are fairly tired and done,</div>
  <div class="i1">For since the game was started,</div>
  <div class="i2">Full three score miles they'd run.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">While light as cork on water</div>
  <div class="i2">The fox was floating on,</div>
  <div class="i1">You could not tell by seeing him,</div>
  <div class="i2">A furlong he had run.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">He swam into the middle,</div>
  <div class="i2">Then turned him round about,</div>
  <div class="i1">And by the hunters on the bank</div>
  <div class="i2">Was heard to laugh and shout.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"Ho! ho! ye gallant hunters!</div>
  <div class="i2">When must I come again?</div>
  <div class="i1">For never shall ye want a fox,</div>
  <div class="i2">To chase along the plain.</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">his</span> ballad is founded on an event which took place in the latter part
of the year 1848. A gamekeeper of the earl of Ripon went out one night
about his usual business, and was found next morning, near one of the
plantations on Hutton Moor, shot dead. A notorious poacher, who was seen
in the neighbourhood on the day of the murder, was apprehended and tried
at York assizes, but acquitted for want of evidence; he subsequently
emigrated to America, where he died, and is said to have confessed that
he was the murderer.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">his</span> song was composed to commemorate an event which created much
sensation in Yorkshire, and indeed throughout all England, in
September, 1853; this was the inauguration and opening of a palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
dedicated to industry near Shipley in Airedale. These works were built
for the manufacture of alpaca and mohair fabrics, and named Saltaire
from Salt&mdash;the name of the owner, Titus Salt, esq., M.P. for
Bradford&mdash;and Aire, the name of the river on which they were erected.
The buildings cover an area of eleven and half acres, will contain 1,200
looms capable of producing 30,000 yards of cloth, or mixed goods, per
day, or nearly 18 miles of cloth, and employing about 5,000 people.</p>

<p>The town of Saltaire is built upon the best principles, including every
convenience necessary for promoting the health and comfort of the
population. Not only will it be a model town as regards its spacious
squares and streets, grounds for recreation, schools, and church, (which
has lately been opened, and cost 11,000<i>l.</i>, and is perhaps the most
beautiful in its interior of any church in Yorkshire,) its baths and
washhouses, and all that philanthropy can suggest, or art supply, to
further improvement.</p>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span class="fontsize">A</span>T Bretton Hall, near Wakefield, known so well,</div>
  <div class="i2dr">Sir William Wentworth Blackett once did dwell;</div>
  <div class="i1">That mansion was his own; there, with his bride,</div>
  <div class="i1">In pomp and splendour, he did once reside.</div>
  <div class="i1">Yet, in the midst of all that he possest,</div>
  <div class="i1">A rambling mind disturb'd sir William's breast;</div>
  <div class="i1">His lady and his home he left behind;</div>
  <div class="i1">Says he, "The end of this wide world I'll find;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">The earth's extensive, but, you may depend on't,</div>
  <div class="i1">Before e'er I return, I'll find the end on't."</div>
  <div class="i1">So he embark'd on board a ship, we find,</div>
  <div class="i1">And, sailing, left her ladyship behind,</div>
  <div class="i1">Who oft in sorrow did his absence mourn,</div>
  <div class="i1">And sighing said, "Oh, that he would return!</div>
  <div class="i1">For, be his voyage rough or smooth at sea,</div>
  <div class="i1">It is a cruel bitter blast to me."</div>
  <div class="i1">Sir William, he rolls on through winds and waves;</div>
  <div class="i1">Undaunted, he all kinds of weather braves;</div>
  <div class="i1">Nor his strange project e'er relinquish'd he,</div>
  <div class="i1">Till one-and-twenty years he'd been at sea;</div>
  <div class="i1">Then, p'rhaps, he thought, "Good lack! the world is round;</div>
  <div class="i1">The end is nowhere&mdash;so it can't be found;</div>
  <div class="i1">And, as I'm weary of this wild-goose chase,</div>
  <div class="i1">At home again, e'er long I'll show my face."</div>
  <div class="i1">Then off he set, but little was aware,</div>
  <div class="i1">What would transpire on his arrival there:</div>
  <div class="i1">For while sir William rov'd as here express'd,</div>
  <div class="i1">Another "Sir," his lady thus address'd:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">"Sir William's gone, (ne'er to return again)</div>
  <div class="i1">Past this world's end, which long he sought in vain,</div>
  <div class="i1">There's not a doubt he's found the end of life;</div>
  <div class="i1">But don't be troubled; you shall be my wife."</div>
  <div class="i1">She listen'd, till at length she gave consent,</div>
  <div class="i1">And straightway to church then this couple went.</div>
  <div class="i1">Sir William does about this wedding hear,</div>
  <div class="i1">As he unto his journey's end draws near;</div>
  <div class="i1">And thus he does within his mind reflect:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">"This sly usurper I shall now detect:</div>
  <div class="i1">Soon shall he know, though much against his will,</div>
  <div class="i1">At Bretton hall I have dominion still;</div>
  <div class="i1">Those woods and fertile fields my own I call,</div>
  <div class="i1">With this magnificent, this splendid hall:</div>
  <div class="i1">And now I come to claim them as my own,</div>
  <div class="i1">Though, by my dress, not from a beggar known;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">My clothes are turn'd to rags, and, by the weather,</div>
  <div class="i1">My skin is tann'd till it resembles leather;</div>
  <div class="i1">So now I'll act the beggar bold and rude,</div>
  <div class="i1">And at this wedding boldly I'll intrude,</div>
  <div class="i1">And, though admittance I may be denied,</div>
  <div class="i1">I'll rob the merry bridegroom of his bride."</div>
  <div class="i1">Then at his own hall door one rap he gave,</div>
  <div class="i1">Resolv'd the inmates' charity to crave.</div>
  <div class="i1">So he presented his request, 'tis said,</div>
  <div class="i1">And they presented him&mdash;a crust of bread!</div>
  <div class="i1">The bread he took, and then, to their surprise,</div>
  <div class="i1">He ask'd the servants for some beer likewise.</div>
  <div class="i1">"No, no," said they, "beer we shall give you none;</div>
  <div class="i1">You saucy drunken vagabond, begone!"</div>
  <div class="i1">At length (with much ado) some beer he got,</div>
  <div class="i1">And quickly he return'd the empty pot;</div>
  <div class="i1">And straightway then into the hall went he,</div>
  <div class="i1">And said, he wish'd her ladyship to see.</div>
  <div class="i1">"You can by no means see her," answer'd they,</div>
  <div class="i1">"She's newly married! 'tis her wedding-day!"</div>
  <div class="i1">"Married!" the feigned beggarman replied,</div>
  <div class="i1">"Then I'll not go till I have seen the bride."</div>
  <div class="i1">Then tow'rds the dining-room his course he bent,</div>
  <div class="i1">The servants quick pursued with one consent,</div>
  <div class="i1">And seized him, with intent to turn him out.</div>
  <div class="i1">"Come back, you villain; what are you about?"</div>
  <div class="i1">"About my bus'ness, to be sure," quoth he,</div>
  <div class="i1">"The room I'll enter, and the bride I'll see."</div>
  <div class="i1">"We'll see you out of doors," the servants said;</div>
  <div class="i1">And now of course, a clam'rous din they made,</div>
  <div class="i1">Just then, the bride, on hearing such a clatter,</div>
  <div class="i1">Open'd the door, to see what was the matter.</div>
  <div class="i1">This noble beggar thus obtain'd a sight</div>
  <div class="i1">Of her who erstwhile was his heart's delight,</div>
  <div class="i1">He viewed her in her nuptial garments dress'd,</div>
  <div class="i1">And did of her a glass of wine request,</div>
  <div class="i1">Which she denied&mdash;who little did suppose</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">The ragged stranger was her wealthy spouse;</div>
  <div class="i1">Then straight into the dining-room he went,</div>
  <div class="i1">And down he sat among the guests content.</div>
  <div class="i1">Says he, "You'll grant me my request I know;</div>
  <div class="i1">A glass of wine I'll have before I go."</div>
  <div class="i1">The bride at length, complied with his request,</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus thinking to despatch the ragged guest,</div>
  <div class="i1">But when he did this glass of wine obtain,</div>
  <div class="i1">He drank and fill'd, and drank and fill'd again.</div>
  <div class="i1">The guests astonish'd and disgusted, view'd,</div>
  <div class="i1">Whilst he proceeded to be far more rude;</div>
  <div class="i1">Around the bride's fair neck he threw his arm,</div>
  <div class="i1">And gave a kiss, which did her much alarm,</div>
  <div class="i1">On him she frown'd, and threaten'd him with law,</div>
  <div class="i1">Says he, "Your threats I value not a straw:</div>
  <div class="i1">My conduct to reprove is all in vain,</div>
  <div class="i1">For what I've done I mean to do again.</div>
  <div class="i1">Madam, your bridegroom's in an awkward case;</div>
  <div class="i1">This night I do intend to take his place."</div>
  <div class="i1">And while upon her countenance he pores,</div>
  <div class="i1">The guests agree to kick him out of doors.</div>
  <div class="i1">"The deuce is in the beggarman," they cried;</div>
  <div class="i1">"He means to either beg or steal the bride."</div>
  <div class="i1">"No, no," says he, "I claim her as my own."</div>
  <div class="i1">He smil'd and then he did himself make known,</div>
  <div class="i1">Saying, "William Wentworth Blackett is my name;</div>
  <div class="i1">For my long absence I'm much to blame;</div>
  <div class="i1">But safe and sound I have return'd at last,</div>
  <div class="i1">So let's forgive each other all that's past."</div>
  <div class="i1">The bride did her first bridegroom recognise;</div>
  <div class="i1">With joy transported, to his arms she flies;</div>
  <div class="i1">And, whilst they tenderly each other kiss,</div>
  <div class="i1">The disappointed bridegroom they dismiss;</div>
  <div class="i1">Who inwardly did his hard case lament,</div>
  <div class="i1">Hung down his head, and out of door he went.</div>
  <div class="i1">"I'm robb'd of this fair jewel, now," thinks he;</div>
  <div class="i1">"How cruel is this tender spouse to me!"</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">Awhile he scratched his head, then heaved a sigh,</div>
  <div class="i1">Then eyed the hall again, and wip'd his eye.</div>
  <div class="i1">Sir William freely did forgive his wife;</div>
  <div class="i1">They liv'd together till the end of life.</div>
  <div class="i1">My honest story I must now conclude,</div>
  <div class="i1">Which may by some be as a fiction view'd;</div>
  <div class="i1">But, sirs, the boots in which sir William went,</div>
  <div class="i1">Are kept in memory of that event;</div>
  <div class="i1">The very hat he wore preserv'd has been,</div>
  <div class="i1">At Bretton hall&mdash;where they may yet be seen.</div>

  <div class="i1">The devil down the chimney came with his long horns and a light,</div>
  <div class="i1">Two men that were in readiness seized him in a trice,</div>
  <div class="i1">And they held the devil just as fast, as if he'd been in a vice.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Next day great crowds of people went to see the devil there,</div>
  <div class="i1">But they say he changed his shape, and so it did appear,</div>
  <div class="i1">For when he found the old woman safe, so that he could not touch her,</div>
  <div class="i1">He lost his horns and tail, and turned out to be a butcher!</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">The devil often has been blamed when innocent, 'tis true,</div>
  <div class="i1">But now he is caught in the fact, they will give him his due,</div>
  <div class="i1">And since he bears such a bad name, there's no doubt but they will</div>
  <div class="i1">Keep him prisoner, as long as he lives, at Wakefield tread-mill.</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">We are all brave poaching lads, our names we dare not tell,</div>
  <div class="i2">And if we meet the keeper, boys, we'll make his head to swell.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">On the fifth of November last, it being a star-light night,</div>
  <div class="i1">The time it was appointed, boys, that we were all to meet,</div>
  <div class="i1">When at twelve o'clock at midnight, boys, we all did fire a gun,</div>
  <div class="i1">And soon, my lads, it's we did hear, old hares begin to run.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">We have a dog, they call him Sharp, he Sledmere woods did stray,</div>
  <div class="i1">The keeper he fell in with him and fain would him betray;</div>
  <div class="i1">He fired two barrels at the dog, intending him to kill,</div>
  <div class="i1">But by his strength and speed of foot he tript across the hill.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">All on one side and both his thighs he wounded him full sore,</div>
  <div class="i1">Before we reached home that night with blood was covered o'er;</div>
  <div class="i1">On recovering of his strength again, revenged for evermore,</div>
  <div class="i1">There's never a hare shall him escape that runs on Sledmere shore.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">We have a lad, they call him Jim, he's lame on all one leg,</div>
  <div class="i1">Soon as the gun is shoulder'd up, his leg begins to wag;</div>
  <div class="i1">When the gun presented fire, and the bird came tumbling down,</div>
  <div class="i1">This lad he kick'd him with his club before he reached the ground.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">So as we as march'd up Burlington road, we loaded every gun,</div>
  <div class="i1">Saying if we meet a keeper bold we'll make him for to run,</div>
  <div class="i1">For we are all bright Sledmere lads, our names we will not tell,</div>
  <div class="i1">But if we meet a keeper bold we'll make his head to swell.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">We landed into Cherry woods; we went straight up the walk;</div>
  <div class="i1">We peak'd the pheasants in the trees, so softly we did talk;</div>
  <div class="i1">We mark'd all out, what we did see, till we return'd again,</div>
  <div class="i1">For we were going to Colleywoodbro' to fetch away the game.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Come, all you gallant poaching lads, if I must have my will,</div>
  <div class="i1">Before we try to shoot this night let's try some hares to kill;</div>
  <div class="i1">For shooting, you very well know, it makes terrible sound,</div>
  <div class="i1">So if we shoot before we hunt we shall disturb the ground.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">We landed into Suddaby fields, to set we did begin,</div>
  <div class="i1">Our dog he was so restless there, we scarce could keep him in;</div>
  <div class="i1">But when our dog we did let loose, 'tis true they call him Watch,</div>
  <div class="i1">And before we left that ground that night he fifteen hares did catch.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">So it's eight cock-pheasants and five hens, all these we marked right well,</div>
  <div class="i1">We never fired gun that night but down a pheasant fell.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">You gentlemen wanting pheasants, unto me you must apply,</div>
  <div class="i1">Both hares and pheasants you shall have, and them right speedily.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">So now, my lads, it's we'll gan yam, we'll take the nearest way,</div>
  <div class="i1">And if we meet a keeper bold his body we will bray;</div>
  <div class="i1">For we are all bright Sledmere lads, our names we will not tell,</div>
  <div class="i1">But if we meet a keeper bold his head we'll make to swell.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">So come, you poaching lads, who love to hunt the game,</div>
  <div class="i1">And let us fix a time when we will meet again;</div>
  <div class="i1">For at Colleywoodbro' there's plenty of game, but we'll gan no more,</div>
  <div class="i1">The next port shall be Kirby Hill where hares do run by scores.</div>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The famous <i>Reafen</i>, or enchanted standard, in which the Danes put
great confidence. It contained the figure of a raven, which had been
inwoven, by the three sisters of Hinguar and Hubba, with many magical
incantations, and which, by its different movements, prognosticated, as
the Danes believed, the good or bad success of any enterprise.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Eldest son of Gilbert de Gant, nephew to William, duke of
Normandy. Walter was a person of great humanity and piety; who, when
advanced in years, and near his death, commanded a regiment of Flemings
and Normans in this engagement. He founded the priory of Bridlington,
and added buildings to the abbey of Bardney, which his father had
restored. He married Maud, daughter of Stephen, earl of Brittany and
Richmond, had with her all Swaledale, in Frank-marriage; and died,
fourth Stephen, leaving issue three sons, Gilbert, who succeeded him,
Robert, and Geoffrey.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> William le Gros, chief of those gallant barons at the
engagement; and in reward for the great valour displayed by him on that
occasion was forthwith advanced to the earldom of Yorkshire. He was
distinguished among the Anglo-Norman barons for his liberality towards
the various religious orders, having founded a Cistercian abbey at
Edenham, in Lincolnshire, and one at Meux in Yorkshire, not far from his
castle of Skipsey; a monastery of black canons at Thornton-upon-Humber;
and a hospital at Newton. He was also the founder of the castle of
Scarborough. He died in 1179, leaving two daughters, his co-heirs.
Hawyse, married first to William de Mandeville, earl of Essex, secondly
to William de Fortibus; and Amicia, married to Eston.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Robert de Brus, son of Robert who came over with the
Conqueror, by Agnes his wife, daughter of Waltheg, earl of St. Clair. He
had an interview with David, king of Scotland, before the battle, to
endeavour to persuade him to desist. He was no less distinguished for
piety than valour. He founded Guisborough priory; gave the church of
Middlesborough to Whitby; and conferred on the abbey of St Mary, at
York, his lordships of Appleton and Hornby. He died in 1141, and was
buried at Guisborough; leaving issue, by Agnes his wife, Adam and
Robert.</p>

<p>Adam de Brus, lord of Skelton, son and heir of the above, who fought by
the side of his father in this engagement. Having adhered to king
Stephen throughout his stormy and disastrous career, he incurred the
displeasure of Henry II. who deprived him of his castle of Danby in
Cleveland. He died in 1167, and was buried at Guisborough, leaving
issue, by Ivetta, his wife, Adam, commonly called Adam the Second, and
Agnes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Lord of Helmsley and Kirkham, and one of the principal
commanders in this battle; and, although this is the only battle we find
him engaged in, his address to the soldiers shows him a man of valour in
defence of his country. He founded the abbey of Rievaulx and Kirkham;
and died in 1153, and was buried in the abbey of Rievaulx, where two
years before he had become a monk.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Son of Nigel de Albini, who assumed the name of Mowbray. He
was one of the commanders in this battle, though then in minority; and,
adhering to king Stephen, was with him at the battle of Lincoln, and
there taken prisoner. He was a benefactor to no fewer than thirty-five
religious houses, and founded the abbey of Byland, and the priory of
Newburgh, in the neighbourhood of his castle at Thirsk. So fervent was
his devotion that he twice took upon him the cross, and made journeys to
the Holy Land, and upon his return retired to the calm seclusion of
Byland abbey, where he assumed the monastic habit, and ended his days;
leaving, by his wife Alice de Gant, two sons, Nigel and Robert.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Thurstan, the twenty-eighth archbishop of York, and who was
at this period Lieutenant-Governor of the North, organized the troops
that fought this famous battle, and had the command as far as Thirsk, at
which place he resigned, on account of sickness, his authority to Ralph,
bishop of Orkney, of whom little is known. The archbishop of York used
to ordain bishops with the title of Orkney; but Torffæus is of opinion
that they were merely titulars, to give greater show of authority to the
see of York; and he is positive that this bishop did never reside in the
isles of Orkney, and that Ralph, designated bishop of Orkney, had been a
presbyter of York.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The following were among the "valiante chiefetaynes:"&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bernard de Baliol</i>, nephew to Guy de Baliol. After this battle he
adhered to Stephen, and was taken prisoner with him at the battle of
Lincoln. He is supposed to be the founder of the castle thence called
Bernard castle; was a benefactor to the monks of St. Mary's Abbey, York,
and those of Rievaulx.</p>

<p><i>Richard de Curcy</i>, represented by Hugustald as a valiant commander in
this battle. He was succeeded by William de Curcy, sewer to king Henry
II.</p>

<p><i>Robert de Ferrars</i>, youngest son of Henry de Ferrers, by Berta his
wife. He commanded the Derbyshire men in this battle, and for his
bravery was forthwith advanced to the earldom of Derby, which honour he
did not long enjoy, dying the following year, 1139, leaving Robert
second earl.</p>

<p><i>William Fossard</i>, son of Robert, was taken prisoner with Stephen at the
battle of Lincoln. He left issue Joane, married to Robert de Turnham.</p>

<p><i>Ralph Hanselyn</i>, descended from Goisfrid Alselin. He commanded the
Nottinghamshire men in this battle, and resided principally at Shelford
in that county. He left issue Rose, married to Thomas Bardulf.</p>

<p><i>Ilbert de Lacy</i>, lord of Pontefract. He married Alice, daughter of
Gilbert de Gant, and dying without issue, Henry his brother succeeded
him.</p>

<p><i>Gilbert de Lacy</i>, brother of the above. Hemingford and other historians
inform us that he was the only knight slain.</p>

<p><i>William Peverell</i>, son of Ranulph, had the castle of Nottingham given
him by the Conqueror. He was taken prisoner with Stephen at the battle
of Lincoln; his castle was given by the empress Maud to William Painell;
but in the year following his soldiers recovered it by stratagem in the
night. He was living in 1141.</p>

<p><i>William de Percy</i>, son of Richard. He gave to the monks of Fountains
two oxgangs of land, three to the monks of Whitby, and one to the monks
of Bridlington. He married Adelidis de Tunebrige, and had issue four
sons, Walter, Alan, Richard, and William; and two daughters, Maud and
Agnes. His sons dying, Agnes, who married Joscelaine de Louvaine,
younger son of Godfrey, duke of Brabant, eventually became sole heiress,
and her husband assumed the name of Percy.</p>

<p><i>Robert de Stutevile</i>, son of Robert, was sheriff of Yorkshire in 16
Henry II., and was engaged in the battle fought near Alnwick, 20 Henry
II. He founded a monastery at Keldholme, another at Rosedale, and gave
to the monks of St. Mary's Abbey, York, one carucate of land. He was
succeeded by his son Robert, who gave large possessions to the monks of
Rievaulx.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> In 1152, Scotland lost, says Sir Walter Scott, a treasure
by the death of the inestimable prince Henry. He left by Ada, an English
lady of quality, a family of three sons and as many daughters. In the
subsequent year the venerable David followed his son. Having discharged
all his duty as a man and a monarch, by settling his affairs as well as
the early age of his grandchildren would permit, he was found dead, in

the court rolls at Wakefield, 35 Edward I., John de Lockwood, of
Lockwood, was presented and afterwards found guilty of having forcibly
ejected one Matthew de Linthwaite from his free tenement, and when the
earl's grave and bailiff came to take possession thereof, he made an

gave bread to Adam Beaumont, he threw it at him with disdain; on which
sir John said he would weed out the offspring of his blood, as they weed
out the weed from corn;" but this threatening was so far from being
verified that sir John's male issue were entirely cut off, whilst that
of Beaumont continued in John the third son. The preceding verse
mentions only "two boys;" but the pedigree of the family gives a third,
who probably was an infant at the time, and therefore too young to be
noticed. Adam appears to have only been about five years of age; this
may account for the different behaviour of the two boys.</p></div>

battle with the Eland men, in Anely wood;" from which we learn that
Lockwood retired to a solitary place called Camel hall, near Cawthorn
(now Cannon hall), where he was subsequently taken by the sheriff and
his men, after a desperate resistance, and cruelly put to death, to the
utter extirpation of the ancient family of Lockwood, of Lockwood, in the
West Riding of Yorkshire.
</p><p>
<i>Adam Beaumont</i>, upon hearing of the death of Lockwood, and that
precepts were sent from London to the sheriff to arrest him, resolved to
leave the country; and having landed in France, by some means or other
got into the service of the knights of Rhodes. Some years after, his
friends received an account of his life and death; from which it appears
he resided sometimes at Rhodes, amongst the knights there, and sometimes
in Hungary, where, in one of the engagements against the Turks, he
honourably ended his life.</p></div>

Armthorpe. It is not now known with certainty to whom we are to
attribute the authorship of these lines. They appeared in the
"<cite>Yorkshire Journal</cite>," of Saturday January 19, 1788, a newspaper at that
period printed and published at Doncaster, by Thomas Sanderson. In
introducing the subject he says, "The following Ballad on Armthorpe
Bells was wrote some years ago, supposed by a gentleman of this town,
sometime since deceased, and were sent to Mr. Anstey, author of the
<cite>Bath Guide</cite>, nephew to the Rev. Christopher Anstey, the then rector of
Armthorpe. They were for some time handed about in manuscript, but
having never appeared in public may not prove unacceptable to our
readers; and we hope the vein of wit and humour, which runs through the
whole poem, will sufficiently apologize for its length." Who the
gentleman thus alluded to was we are unable to state. An impression has
prevailed that they were written by Mr. Anstey, the author of the <cite>Bath
Guide</cite>; but, in the absence of any positive evidence to that effect, we
must assume that the proprietor of the <cite>Yorkshire Journal</cite>, writing in
1788, when the subject would be fresh and talked about, is more likely
to be correct in the statement above made. Mr. Christopher Anstey, the
poet, was born 31 Oct. 1724, and died 3 Aug. 1805. The Rev. Christopher
Anstey, rector of Armthorpe from about 1771 to 1784, died June 17, 1784,
aged 73, and was buried at Doncaster.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_174_174" id="Footnote_174_174"></a><a href="#FNanchor_174_174"><span class="label">[174]</span></a> Armthorpe is a village, situated in an agricultural
district, about three miles south-east of Doncaster. An account of it at
length may be read in Hunter's able work, the "History of South
Yorkshire." The place lay close to the confines of the ancient Chace of
Hatfield, and once formed a valuable part of the possessions of the
monks of the abbey of Roche. At the dissolution of the abbey the manor
of Armthorpe came to the crown. In 3 James I. the king granted it to sir
Robert Swyft, of Tristrop, (now Streetthorpe,) knt. The family of Cooke,
of Wheatley, had a good estate here, most of which sir George Cooke,
bart. sold, in 1804, to John Walbanke Childers, esq., of Cantley, in
whose family it remains. The church is dedicated to St. Mary. Dr.
Miller, in his "History of Doncaster," 1803, briefly remarks that it was
then "a very small mean building, with one bell hanging on the outside
of it, and nothing worth noticing within." Hunter, in 1828, remarks that
it is a small building of one pace, with two bells hanging in a kind of
pent-house on the roof, and is a fair specimen of what the original
churches of the smaller country parishes must have been. "This," he
says, "is the only instance of a church without a tower in the deanery."
The living is a rectory in the gift of the crown, and is now held by the
Rev. H. J. Branson, M.A., who was presented thereto, by Lord Chancellor
Brougham, in 1834.</p></div>

in the year 1768, from Leeds to London, during the winter season, and
performed its journey in two days and a half, at that period considered
very expeditious travelling. Probably it derived its name from this
extraordinary swiftness. The advertisement of this coach, inserted in
the <cite>Leeds Intelligencer</cite>, of January 3, 1769, after stating the fares,
the places from whence it set out, &amp;c. &amp;c., concludes in the usual
manner, viz. "Performed (<i>if God permit</i>) by Messrs. Stokes, Benton and
Co;" from this expression coaches, in those days, were by some
irreverently styled "God-permits." As far back as 1669 a coach called
the "Flying Coach" went from Oxford to London in one day. Perhaps any
vehicle became entitled to the appellation that could go along at a
moderate trot. In 1791 were advertised "New Flying Stage-Waggons."</p></div>
